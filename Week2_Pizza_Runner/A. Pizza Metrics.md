FROM ##runner_orders_temp
WHERE cancellation NOT LIKE '%Cancellation%'
GROUP BY runner_id
````

#### Answer:

| **runner_id** | **total_successfull_order** |
|---------------|-----------------------------|
| 1             | 4                           |

FROM ##customer_orders_temp
GROUP BY DATEPART(hour FROM order_time)
ORDER BY DATEPART(hour FROM order_time)
````

#### Answer:

| **hour_of_day** | **total_pizza_volumn** |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| 11 - 12         | 1                      |
| 13 - 14         | 3                      |

````sql
SELECT 
	DATEPART(weekday FROM order_time) as weekday,

	COUNT(order_id) AS total_pizza_volumn,
	ROUND(100.0 * CAST(COUNT(order_id) AS FLOAT) / SUM(COUNT(order_id)) OVER(),2) AS percentage_ordered_pizza
FROM ##customer_orders_temp
GROUP BY DATEPART(weekday FROM order_time), DATENAME(weekday,order_time)
ORDER BY DATEPART(weekday FROM order_time)
````

#### Answer:

| **weekday** | **weekday_name** | **total_pizza_volumn** | **percentage_ordered_pizza** |
